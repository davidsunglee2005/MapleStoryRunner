# MapleStoryRunner

This is a Maplestory themed endless runner, inspired by Google Chrome's dinosaur runner game. This was built using the GDScript, as well as Godot game engine which is free and open source. 

You can play the game here, at this link: https://holeesin.itch.io/maplestoryrunner

Fun fact, the sprite used for the player is based on my actual character in Maplestory ðŸ‘€

### Instructions
The game is simple, jump using the space bar to avoid enemies running across the screen towards the player. Additionally, the player will gain points based on the amount of enemies avoided. Grab the SilverMane powerup which acts as an extra life.
